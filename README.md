# Discord-bot

A Simple bot for discord with some of features for minecraft and tarkov !!

The bot was originaly created for creating random teams for minecraft bedwars.
The project was aborted but I had the idea of creating a new bot.

This bot kept the remains of the minecraft commands and was upgraded to integrate the Escape From Tarkov game wiki.

With friend we played a lot of Tarkov and it was very annoying to search on the wiki everytime to see the ballistics of the game bullets.
So i made a bot capable of searching anything from the wiki of the game.
The bot have an integrated web scrapper (puppeteer) that can search in the game wiki to return information about any request.

You can search for ballistics, maps, quests, equipement, weapons. everything that can be found in the wiki.
